/*
"Reducer helpers" are functions that create reducers.

They generate a ReducerStub, which is a temporary
object that is later used to generate a reducer:

// first, the user creates a ReducerStub

const reducer = ReducerStub('filter', '$a.b')

// then, when the stub is passed to transform,
// it will be used to generate a reducer object

dp.transform(reducer, data)

The helpers exposed on DataPoint are the ReducerStub
function bound to a string identifier using bindStubFunction
